                <h4>What size can a team be?</h4>
                <p>Teams can be up to 5 people. If you want to hack alone, that is totally fine. If you are still looking for a team, don't worry, we will have team building and pitching sessions at the event. You can apply at any time and join any team at any time. The team question in the application is only to make sure the entire team makes it to the event.</p>
