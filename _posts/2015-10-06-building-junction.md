## How it all started

At first the idea of hosting a hackathon for 500 participants in the slushy and dark city of Helsinki - at the beginning of November - seemed a bit of a challenge. However we decided to tackle it - we had a vision to create the coolest hackathon Europe has ever seen and the crappy Finnish weather wasn’t going to stop us.

We visioned a hackathon that would be something big, cool and truly thrilling. Something that sets up a new normal for the entire concept. That’s why we realized from early on that the production of the event would have to be a lot more than just setting up an internet connection, a few tables in a brightly lit lecture hall and ordering a large pizza delivery.

## What does it take In order to get a sneak

In order to get a sneak peek to what does it take to build up a massive hackathon event such as Junction, we asked Ville and Jesse - the guys in charge of the production - to tell a bit more about the process. They nailed the three main things down: hands, design and practicalities.

### Hands
An event this size requires quite a lot of people. Just to get the show running we recruited a team of 50+ volunteers to help in putting Junction together. When the moment of truth takes place, they will build the whole event from the ground up - everything from tables to electrifying to whole place.

### Design
To create an event that both looks great and works seamlessly, we have to make sure that there is also people with experience from similar events that come in to help with the more detailed planning. That’s why we have hired the people who produce Slush to come and design the event.

### Practicalities
A hackathon for 500 participants requires tons of work with the technical side making sure that the electricity and internet connections are taken care of. To keep the hackers energized we have partners that will bring food and drinks as well as proper meals from a catering service a few times a day to keep everybody happy. When hosting an event that has tons of latest technology playing a major part in it, we have also taken into consideration security. We will have our own security team making sure only those who have access get in to the hall.

*Sun Effects created the the original floorpan of the event. However, the tent that was originally planned got too small so the new design features a bigger tent to accommodate a bigger stage and more booths for partners.*

All in all, production of an event like this cannot be organized based on just a few action points assuming that it will work itself out. We have to make sure that when the event takes place, every single detail is taken care off, and that every minute is scheduled.

That’s why we are relentlessly keeping all the details together - while constantly designing even cooler stuff for the event.

Junction takes place in the former boiler hall of Suvilahti, Helsinki - a cool industrial space just next to the city centre. The old boiler hall and its surroundings is the perfect venue for the event.

For the participants, the hall will provide an environment that’s buzzing with new ideas and energy. And everything they need for making those ideas to reality.

When it comes to the tech that you can play with, we’ll have things like a 3D printer, large multi touch wall, drones, latest VR equipment, smart watches, and the list goes on.

As said, building Junction is a process that has one sole purpose, which is to create the most inspiring hacking space possible. And of course create an awesome event around the latest and most greatest tech.
