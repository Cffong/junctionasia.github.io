					<h4>Japan Airlines</h4>
						<p>Ever since we became the first Japanese airline to venture overseas, our predecessors have passed down values that have become one with who we are as an airline. These include the technical knowledge and wisdom gained through our rich history, an uncompromising spirit, and an incredible determination to support the dreams and the people who have them. 
						<br />
						JAL is ever continuing to embrace new challenges as we cater to the needs of all our guests and strive to be the world’s most valued and preferred airline.

					<h4>Terrada Soko</h4>
						<p>Inspired by the treasure house of Shosoin, a registered World Heritage site, as the builder and the keeper of your personal storage room, we strive to be a professional in creating spaces.
						We believe that space does not equate to emptiness.
						We believe that space embraces people’s feeling and nurtures something new.
						We believe that by creating space, we present new value and broader possibility.
						We believe that with our experience and knowledge, we see essence of things we store and give new values to them.
						We believe the space nurtures heritage to be passed on to the next generation and visions for the future.

				<h4>Fab Cafe</h4>
				<p>FabCafe is a space where people can come together, and connect with each other. By providing a variety of digital fabrication tools, including laser cutters and 3D printers, visitors are able to bring their digital data to life.

					FabCafe is where people can enjoy the thrill of making new things together and discovering their answer to the telltale FabCafe question that we always ask, “What do you Fab?”
            		Since the first FabCafe opened in Shibuya, Tokyo in March 2012, FabCafe network has expanded to Taipei, Barcelona, Bangkok, Toulouse and Hida.
