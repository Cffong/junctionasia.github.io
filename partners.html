					<h4>Japan Airlines</h4>
						<p>Ever since we became the first Japanese airline to venture overseas, our predecessors have passed down values that have become one with who we are as an airline. These include the technical knowledge and wisdom gained through our rich history, an uncompromising spirit, and an incredible determination to support the dreams and the people who have them. 
						<br />
						JAL is ever continuing to embrace new challenges as we cater to the needs of all our guests and strive to be the world’s most valued and preferred airline.
