					<div class="partner-box text"><h4>Cozify</h4>
						<p>The Cozify Hub connects different devices from different manufacturers into one seamlessly working entity.
						Cozify uses open standards and technologies - And we want to be an open platform ourselves.
						To embrace the open approach, We will setup a developer forum and provide open APIs for all.
						<br><br>
						You will get an API to create your own rules for the hub. For example,
						“Blink lights when someone is at the door” or “Wake me up with music, lights and fresh coffee”.
						Later on, we will let you integrate your own devices and cloud services with Cozify platform.
